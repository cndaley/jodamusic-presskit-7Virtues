          <h2>Raul Da Gama’s review of The Seven Heavenly Virtues</h2>
        </header>
        <section>
          <div class="blockquote-with-source">
            <blockquote>
              It is pleasantly surprising when Joseph Daley ascends from the brassy bass realm of the tuba, putting down his massive instrument, to conduct a chamber orchestra. What should not come as a surprise, however, is that Mr. Daley, a musical intellect of the highest order, should put his mind to another complex project—a follow-up to his 2010 Jaro release The Seven Deadly Sins. This time Mr. Daley delves deep into his soul, coming up to relocate the abstract spirituality of The Seven Heavenly Virtues to his new and wonderful landscape of music. Again, Mr. Daley draws upon his vast and varied knowledge of musical colours—experiences he gained from playing with Gil Evans and Carla Bley, among others—but has decided to rely mainly on a part of the palette (strings accented at times by the melodic orchestral percussion of Warren Smith together with Satoshi Takeishi and Jerry Gonzalez, who also doubles on trumpet, as well as Lafayette Harris and Onaje Allan Gumbs on keyboards. The effects are stupendous, to say the least.
              <br />
              <br />
              The depth of thought of each virtue is matched by the density of tone and texture, and the richness of colour and shade created by sets of harmonising strings from soaring violins and fibrillating violas to gasping cellos and rumbling basses. Percussion and keyboards, when introduced into each part of the suite add accents and angular timbre to the music, often joined in by basses playing pizzicato in counterpoint with each other. And then there is the character that is given to each virtue; echoed in the richness of timbre and colour by the confluence of instrumentation. “Diligence” is a sublime example. Introduced by the melodically tuned timpani drums played by the inimitable Warren Smith, the percussionist then draws in the strings and keyboards, flushed with the magnificent sound of violins and violas; cellos askance, lean into the melody. Double stops and rhythmic rumbling of the basses—con arco and pizzicato respectively—create a sort of gravitas that sings duty and exactitude, while violins ascending in wailing mode, dappled by interesting accents on the keyboards create a brilliant three—and sometimes four—dimensional piece, superbly paced as if interminably by Mr. Daley. Each virtue is treated with thoughtfulness and an equal measure of ingenuity as on Mr. Daley can. For instance, “Patience” features a lilting melody heralded by strings, “Humility” sways with the exquisite pianism of Lafayette Harris, soon descending into a passage filled with dissonance as if, it seems, to contrast what must be avoided at all costs, i.e., pride, but the pianist restores himself to a poised state and is joined by the basses in a restful sequence that while bringing the sequence to a conclusion draws in the percussionists first and then the whole orchestra in a beautiful conclusion.

                <div class="sectiontitle"><h3>“Music stimulates the mind as it nourishes the soul”</h3></div>

                <br />

                After nearly 40 years of recognition as one of the consummate sidemen on the adventurous music scene
                – with remarkable artists like Sam Rivers, Carla Bley, Gil Evans, Charlie Haden, Taj Mahal and so many
                more – Joseph Daley stunned musicians and fans alike with his brilliant CD, <B>The Seven Deadly Sins</B>,
                released in 2011. The album also received rave reviews and made several Best of 2011 lists. Featuring
                his <strong>Earth Tones Ensemble</strong> (a full Jazz orchestra augmented by six additional low-toned horns, and
                including a seven-member rhythm section and four special guests), this powerfully innovative music
                mines the same rich vein of musical expression as that of immortals like Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington
                and George Russell.

                <br /><br />

                Whether performing with his large ensemble; with his evocative
                <strong>Ebony Brass Quintet</strong>; or in the sparer
                solo, duo or trio contexts; sheer musicality, deeply-hewn emotion and jubilant innovation are always at
                the core of Joseph’s most singular musical expression. Best known for playing the tuba, Joseph also
                plays euphonium and valve trombone; but these days his growing reputation as a visionary composer is
                bringing him worldwide acclaim.

                <br /><br />

                Born in New York City’s Harlem, Joseph began his musical studies in elementary school and received
                high honors and recognition throughout his school years (including the renowned High School of Music
                and Art), and was a member of the most prestigious ensembles in the New York City school system.
                During his high school years, he began performing on the Latin music scene – well-known as one of
                the most powerful foundations of higher musical learning – performing alongside such fine musicians as
                Rene McLean, Monquito Santamaria, Andy Gonzalez, Alex Blake and many others.

                <br /><br />

                A scholarship to the Manhattan School of Music resulted in his Bachelor’s degree in Performance and
                a Master’s degree in Music Education and led to a career as an educator in the New York and New
                Jersey school systems from 1976 until his retirement in 2005. Heavily dedicated to the education of
                young people to the highest values in musical understanding and expression, Joseph balanced his
                extensive educational commitments with recording and performing in the ensembles of some of the most
                provocative musicians on the contemporary jazz scene. In addition to those mentioned above, Joseph
                contributed heavily to groups led by other major artists including Muhal Richard Abrams, Makanda
                Ken McIntyre, Jason Hwang and Dave Douglas, and was an original member of Howard Johnson’s
                groundbreaking tuba ensemble, Gravity. He has also been a longtime collaborator with the highly
                respected composer/ethnomusicologist and master of non-Western instruments, Bill Cole, a relationship
                that is still intact.

                <br /><br />

                Joseph is also currently a member of the highly eclectic ensemble Hazmat Modine, under the direction of
                musician and visual artist Wade Schuman. It was Schuman’s paintings that helped inspire the creation of
                Daley’s Seven Deadly Sins project, which was developed at the McDowell Colony in 2001.

                <br /><br />

                In addition to his Earth Tones Ensemble, Ebony Brass Quintet, duo and trio collaborations and his solo performances,
                Joseph’s focus right now is on his next recording project, The Seven Virtues, featuring a large string ensemble.
                He has also designed an extensive series of educational projects for the university level and
                will be embarking on a series of residency and performance-based projects starting in the 2012/2013 season.

                <br /><br />

                Summing up the purpose and commitment of Joseph Daley….<br />
                “If the music I compose provides one with a sense of beauty,
                inner peace and introspection then I am pleased”

              </div>
